# CI/CD & Infrastructure Automation Modernization

## Overview
Implemented end-to-end CI/CD automation and infrastructure standardization using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Ansible, and Terraform.

## The Challenge
- Manual deployment steps
- Environment inconsistencies
- Lack of monitoring
- Slow release cycles

## Implementation Approach

### Pipeline Engineering
- Configured Jenkins pipelines
- Integrated GitHub repositories
- Implemented build, test, deploy stages

### Infrastructure as Code
- Developed Terraform modules
- Standardized environment provisioning
- Reduced configuration drift

### Configuration Management
- Automated server setup using Ansible
- Created reusable roles
- Improved scalability

### Observability
- Integrated monitoring stack
- Implemented log aggregation

## Tools & Technologies
Jenkins  
GitHub Actions  
Terraform  
Ansible  
Docker  
Prometheus  
Grafana  
ELK Stack  

## Results
- Faster release cycles
- Improved environment consistency
- Reduced manual errors
- Better infrastructure reliability

## Key Takeaways
Automation is foundational to scalable DevOps practices.
